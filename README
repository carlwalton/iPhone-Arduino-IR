This project is designed to allow IR communication from an Arduino using a 
modified version of Ken Shirriff's Multi-Protocol IR Library for Arduino devices.

This code will be modified in the coming weeks to be more efficient, and to 
make better use of the Shirriff IR library I'm using (i.e. without me
editing it). Take this as a first alpha of the software, although everything
appears to be functional at present.
